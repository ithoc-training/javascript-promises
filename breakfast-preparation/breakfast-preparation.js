/*
Goal:
Create a Node.js application to simulate the process of preparing a complete breakfast.
Utilize Promises to manage various asynchronous tasks like toasting bread, boiling water,
brewing coffee, putting butter on bread, putting jam on toast, and preparing the table.

Requirements:
- Jam can be put on toast only after the bread is toasted and butter is put on it.
- Butter can be put on bread only after the bread is toasted.
- Coffee can be brewed only after the water is boiled.
- Water can be boiled and bread can be toasted simultaneously.
- The table can be prepared only after the coffee is brewed and the jam is put on the toast.
